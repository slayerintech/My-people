      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Last updated: <span id="lastUpdated"></span></p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how My People collects, uses, and shares personal information, including location data, when you use the app. By using the app, you agree to the practices described here.</p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Account information: name, email, and app identifiers.</li>
        <li>Location information: precise latitude/longitude when you enable sharing and optional background updates.</li>
        <li>Device information: app version, device type, and diagnostics to maintain service quality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide location sharing features and show linked users on the map.</li>
        <li>Maintain account settings and user permissions (who can view your location).</li>
        <li>Improve reliability, performance, and security of the service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Location Sharing Controls</h2>
      <p>You control whether your location is shared and who can view it. You can toggle sharing on or off at any time inside the app. Background sharing requires additional permission and can be disabled in the app or device settings.</p>

      <h2>Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>With users you approve: your location is visible only to users you link and allow.</li>
        <li>Service providers: we use trusted providers (e.g., Firebase) to store and process data.</li>
        <li>Legal requirements: we may disclose data if required to comply with law or enforce policies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain account and sharing records for as long as your account is active. Location points are stored as part of your current status and last updated time, not as continuous history, unless required to deliver specific features.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We implement technical and organizational measures to protect your data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The app is not directed to children under 13, or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction. If you are under the age of majority, use requires consent from a parent or guardian.</p>

      <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle location sharing on or off at any time.</li>
        <li>Manage who can view your location by linking or removing users.</li>
        <li>Delete your account in Settings to remove stored data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
      <p>We rely on third‑party services such as Firebase (authentication, database, storage) and mapping providers for displaying locations. These services have their own privacy policies and may process data on our behalf.</p>

      <h2>International Transfers</h2>
      <p>Your information may be processed and stored in locations outside your country. We take steps to ensure an adequate level of protection in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to the app or legal requirements. Continued use after an update indicates acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>For questions or requests related to privacy, contact support through the details provided in the store listing.</p>
